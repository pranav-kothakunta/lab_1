## Notes

### Problems Faced and Solutions

1. **Port 3000 was already in use**
   - The server showed an `EADDRINUSE` error because another server was already running on port 3000.
   - Stopped the previous server before starting the new one.

2. **Incorrect Express response method order**
   - Initially used `response.send.status()`.
   - Corrected it to `response.status(404).send()` for the 404 response.

3. **Browser returned 304 while checking `/about`**
   - The browser was using its cached response.
   - Enabled "Disable cache" in the Network tab and reloaded the page to verify the `200` status.
